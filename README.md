# 30-Day Coding Challenge

This repository contains my daily coding practice for 30 days. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, algorithms, and data structure knowledge. Each day, I will commit 3 coding challenges and their solutions in different topics. These challenges are designed to build my proficiency in coding and problem-solving techniques, with a focus on data structures, algorithms, system design, and design patterns.

## Challenge Overview

### Week 1: Data Structures and Algorithms Basics
- Focus on basic data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees (BST), and Arrays.
- Solve problems related to reversing integers, checking for palindromes, and finding the middle element of a list.

### Week 2: Advanced Algorithms and Problem Solving
- Dive deeper into algorithmic challenges such as sorting (quick sort, merge sort), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra’s), and dynamic programming.
- Solve problems like the N-Queens problem, longest common substring, and dynamic programming challenges like coin change.

### Week 3: System Design and Advanced Concepts
- Work on implementing more advanced data structures such as Tries, AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees.
- Solve graph-related problems like topological sorting, BFS, and DFS.
- Focus on solving problems like the maximum product of two numbers, the largest subarray sum, and more.

### Week 4: Design Patterns and Final Projects
- Implement various design patterns such as Singleton, Observer, and Strategy.
- Solve complex algorithmic challenges like the word ladder problem, merge k sorted lists, and trap water problems.

## Daily Structure

Each day consists of 3 different coding problems to solve, ranging from basic data structure tasks to more advanced algorithmic challenges. Below is the breakdown of the tasks per day:

### Example:
**Day 1:**
1. Implement a Linked List (insert, delete, and print functions).
2. Solve the Reverse an Integer problem (e.g., `123` → `321`).
3. Write a function to find the middle element in a linked list.

**Day 2:**
1. Implement Stack using an array.
2. Solve Palindrome checking for a string.
3. Write a program to find the maximum product of two numbers in an array.

... and so on for the remaining days.
